About
-----

I write these during lectures, and then add to them occasionally when mistakes or omissions are discovered.

They're written in Markdown with LaTeX for math. There's a build script that uses [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to generate HTML with MathJax for LaTeX rendering.
